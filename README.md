Flutter Developer
-----------------

Hello, I am Amirreza Haqi. Since I entered the university in 2019, I became interested in programming. I started with front-end programming and learning JavaScript, but when I went further, I was looking for something specific, and I found Flutter and I was able to get a very good relationship with it. And I enjoy coding with it, that's why I changed my field of activity to Flutter

* üåç  I'm based in IRAN
* ‚úâÔ∏è  You can contact me at [amirrezahaqi@gmail.com](mailto:amirrezahaqi@gmail.com)
